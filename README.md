# PY1731 Anki Flashcards
All of my flashcards for WPI's PY1731 (Intro to Religion and Philosphy). 
I personally use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for studying flash cards
because it is very expandable, and also has nice features such as training 
over time. If you don't use Anki, there will be normal text versions of the
cards so that you can import them into other systems.

If you are a memeber of this class, please fork and toss me a pull request... 
sharing is caring!
